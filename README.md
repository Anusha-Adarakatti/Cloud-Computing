# Cloud-Computing

Welcome to the **Cloud-Computing** repository — a collection of hands-on projects and experiments showcasing practical experience with cloud-native technologies.

## About this Repository

This repo serves as a central place where I dump and document my learning projects and real-world implementations focused on:

- **Docker** — containerization and image management
- **Kubernetes** — orchestration of containerized applications
- **Ansible** — automation and configuration management
- **Other Cloud Tools** — various cloud and DevOps related tools and scripts

Each project is structured with clear instructions, code, and configuration files to help understand and replicate the setups.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate practical knowledge and skills in cloud computing technologies
- Provide reusable templates and examples for future projects
- Keep track of my continuous learning journey in DevOps and cloud-native infrastructure

## How to Use

- Browse project folders for specific technologies or use cases
- Follow README and documentation inside each project for setup and usage
- Feel free to fork or clone the repository for your own experimentation and learning
